  <h1>A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM.</h1>
    <p><em>By Edgar Allan Poe</em></p>
    <br>
    <p> Take this kiss upon the brow!<br>
        And, in parting from you now,<br>
        Thus much let me avow—<br>
        You are not wrong, who deem<br>
        That my days have been a dream;<br>
        Yet if hope has flown away<br>
        In a night, or in a day,<br>
        In a vision, or in none,<br>
        Is it therefore the less <em>gone</em>?<br>
        <em>All</em> that we see or seem<br>
        Is but a dream within a dream.<br>
    </p>
    <p> I stand amid the roar <br>
        Of a surf-tormented shore,<br>
        And I hold within my hand<br>
        Grains of the golden sand—<br>
        How few! yet how they creep<br>
        Through my fingers to the deep,<br>
        While I weep—while I weep!<br>
        O God! can I not grasp<br>
        Them with a tighter clasp?<br>
        O God! can I not save<br>
        <em>One</em> from the pitiless wave?<br>
        Is <em>all</em> that we see or seem<br>
        But a dream within a dream?<br>
    </p>
    <p><em>First published March 1849</em></p>
